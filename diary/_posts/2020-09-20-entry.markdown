I might get a job offer next week, but I'm rather ambivalent about it. I wouldn't mind spending more time interviewing to have more options. Let's face it though, the job market is brutal at the moment,  I talked to my boss about it, he said that it's a buyers' market right now, where the companies that are staying afloat/thriving are trying to get the best candidates. I'm inclined to agree although I don't think that I'm an elite candidate for the positions I'm applying for. 

I'm very unhappy at my current company. The only good thing is that we are all still working remotely, which is really a *massive* increase in quality of life... the daily commute is a terrible absurdity that I never want to experience again. 

My hope is that COVID serves as proof that, in the current era, it's completely obsolete to require employees to work in an office, Of course there are exceptions, but come on. If I could, I'd take a good job offer in the UK and live in another country. I'm just not that keen on moving back to the UK...

(It's rather ugly, in a way that's difficult to explain.) 

I'd like to settle down in a couple of years at the latest. I always feel like I'm planning my next move instead of learning to appreciate what I have. It's tiresome.
